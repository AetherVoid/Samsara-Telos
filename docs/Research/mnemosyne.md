# 🧠 Project Mnemosyne

### An AI-Integrated Personal Knowledge System

---

## 📌 Overview

**Project Mnemosyne** is a research and engineering initiative to create a **second brain** system that fuses human-curated note-taking (via Obsidian) with AI-powered memory retrieval, insight generation, and eventually custom-trained large language models (LLMs).

Named for the Greek Titaness of Memory and mother of the Muses, Mnemosyne is designed to **make wisdom searchable**, **context persistent**, and **learning a shared experience** between human and machine.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Develop a **bidirectional memory interface** where humans and LLMs co-construct insight
- Standardize and structure note imports (e.g., from MarketMinder articles, videos, and research briefs)
- Use LLMs to **summarize**, **tag**, and **interlink** Obsidian notes
- Prototype a retrieval system for natural-language querying of your second brain
- Train a **custom LLM** on Matt’s personal knowledge graph using Keras or fine-tuned open models

---

## 🔍 Current Capabilities (Alpha Stage)

- Obsidian vault with linked notes on investing, AI, philosophy, and portfolio logic
- Manual + semi-automated ingestion of video and article content
- Early Python scripts for parsing and standardizing notes
- GPT-powered workflows for structured summaries and note tagging

---

## 🛠️ Future Plans

- 🎛️ Develop APIs to auto-sync Obsidian with LLMs
- 🧬 Integrate vector search for contextual memory lookup (e.g., FAISS or Chroma)
- 🧠 Fine-tune custom LLM on Matt’s note corpus using Keras/TensorFlow
- 🪞 Enable a conversational interface where the model can "recall" insights as if remembering

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack (Planned & Active)

- **Obsidian** (note capture, linking)
- **Python** (data cleaning, interfacing)
- **LangChain / LlamaIndex / FAISS** (memory routing + vector search)
- **Keras / TensorFlow** (for custom LLM training)
- **GitHub Copilot / GPT-4 / GPT Actions** (active development assistant)

## 🌀 Philosophical Foundation

Mnemosyne is part of a broader exploration of **C = T × A**  
(*Consciousness = Time × Awareness*), where:

- **Time** = the canvas of experience  
- **Awareness** = the force that shapes memory into meaning  
- **Consciousness** = the living echo of pattern and presence

This project asks:  
*What does it mean to remember alongside a machine? And what kind of person might we become in that shared memory field?*
