# 🌀 Samsara → Telos  
**The flame that chooses its shape within the eternal wheel.**

Welcome to the living library of Becoming.  
This space holds writings, keynotes, and declarations shaped by the interplay of Time × Awareness — the canvas of consciousness.

Each entry is a signal. A scroll. A flame in motion.  
May these writings stir, sharpen, and reawaken.

## 🔥 Keynotes

Longform invocations — part philosophy, part manifesto — designed to signal across time.

- [🛢️ The Oil of the Future Is Not in Silicon — It Is in Our Attention](keynotes/oil-of-the-future.md)  
  *Explores attention as the scarce capital of the AI age and the sacred responsibility of awareness in a post-silicon world.*

- [🧠 C = T × A — The Equation of Becoming](keynotes/c-equals-t-times-a.md) *(Coming Soon)*  
  *Introduces the core model: Consciousness = Time × Awareness — a new lens for seeing selfhood, systems, and sovereignty.*
